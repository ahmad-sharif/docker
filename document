Dockerfile:
A Dockerfile is a simple text file that contains the commands a user could call to assemble an image.

Example, Dockerfile

FROM ubuntu:latest
MAINTAINER ahmad 

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y python python-pip wget
RUN pip install Flask

ADD hello.py /home/hello.py

WORKDIR /home

Docker Compose:
	-is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
	-define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment.
	-get an app running in one command by just running docker-compose up

Example, docker-compose.yml

version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
    - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
    - .:/code
    - logvolume01:/var/log
    links:
    - redis
  redis:
    image: redis
volumes:
  logvolume01: {}

Note: 
Docker Compose (herein referred to as compose) will use the Dockerfile if you add the build command to your project's docker-compose.yml.
Your Docker workflow should be to build a suitable Dockerfile for each image you wish to create, then use compose to assemble the images using the build command.
You can specify the path to your individual Dockerfiles using build /path/to/dockerfiles/blah where /path/to/dockerfiles/blah is where blah's Dockerfile lives.
